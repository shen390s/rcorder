rcorder for setup login environment
==============================================

Testing
=======
If you build rcorder with -DDEBUG (default), you can test that it works
correctly by running rcorder with the -d flag (it will not actually execute
any rc scripts with -d):

./rcorder -d -r -s nostart rcs.d/*


Install
=======
1. Build this rcorder
2. Make sure it works (see Testing)
3. Install rcorder to location which you want
